# GroundwaterPulseTheory

 This GitHub repository contains MATLAB codes that can be used to reproduce the Li et al. 2004 pulse theory applied in Housego et al. 2021:
 1. LiEquations.pdf has the equations presented in Li et al. 2004
 2. PulseFit.m is a function that can be used to estimate A,B and tp 
 3. Pulse_theory.m will take an input of cross shore locations and a time vector and will output the a matrix of head time series at those locations
 4. PulseND.mat contains the variables needed to plot the non-dimensional version of the Li solution
